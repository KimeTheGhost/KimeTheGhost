- 👋 Hello, I’m Kime! I'm a Brazilian student looking forward to learning more about Github!
- 👀 I’m interested in music and games, and pretty much every other thing there is on the internet.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Technology and Robotics (I'm learning more about coding than everything to be honest.)
- 💞️ I’m still pretty dumb with coding and everything else, so i'm sure i wouldn't be of much help, i'm a quick learner though.
- 📫 You can reach me by my email or by Github.
- 😄 Pronouns: My pronouns are He/Him, though i don't really mind being called by She/Her or They/Them.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm currently learning about Sign Language and how to play a guitar!
